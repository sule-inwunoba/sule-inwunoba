## Brief Introduction
I am a dedicated security professional with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. I am passionate about protecting organizations and individuals from ever-evolving cyber threats. With a strong foundation in SQL and Python and a security mindset, Iâ€™ve applied these skills across various projects to develop robust security solutions and systems.

## Objective

My enthusiasm for technology and to build resilient digital infrastructures that safeguard both technology and the people who depend on it has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as an Analyst.
My long-term goal is to specialize in cloud security, focusing on securing hybrid and multi-cloud environments
